# tess-object-names
messing with giving TIC objects better names

plan is to have names like
* fluffy green scorpion

also we want names that are emojis. We are going to have this limited to the emoji 4.0 list

Maybe also have ability to return the constellation from the TIC id? Other information from the TIC?
